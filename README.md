## Introduction

If you provide a script Repository Mapper will run it on every repository you specify.

It can help with things like:

* Running structured queries on every repository, E.g.
    - Which repositories still use 'go dep'?
    - How many repositories still depend on X version of this package?
    - Find me all usages of the term 'X' across all repositories
    - Which users contribute to which repositories?

* Running scripts and creating pull requests on every repository. E.g.
    - Auto upgrade X dependency in every repository
    - Add this LICENCE file to every repository

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/vendasta/repository-mapper
```

## Usage

Let's look at an example invocation to break it down.

```bash
repository-mapper \
  --org=vendasta \
  --branch-name=mapper/contributors \
  --script=./test.sh \
  --user-name="foo@vendasta.com" \
  --auth-token="auth-token" \
  repo1 repo2 repo3
```

Let's break it down.

## Arguments

Run `repository-mapper -h` for usage information

```bash
$ repository-mapper -h
Run scripts and queries on repositories across your org

Usage:
  repository-mapper [flags] repos...

Flags:
      --auth-token string         Github auth token
  -b, --branch-name string        The branch to create. Should be globally unique.
  -d, --description string        Description of the PR
  -h, --help                      help for repository-mapper
  -p, --make-pr                   Create a PR in each repo after running the script
  -o, --org string                The github organization the repos live in. (default "vendasta")
      --rsa-key-file string       (optional) The location of an rsa key with github permissions, note this doesn't work currently (default "/Users/jbaxter/.ssh/id_rsa")
      --rsa-key-password string   (optional) The password for your ssh key if you have one configured, note this doesn't work currently
  -s, --script string             Path to the script to run in each repository
  -t, --title string              Title of the PR
      --user-name string          Github user name
  
```

Pass as many repositories as you like as positional arguments. Simply provide the short-form name of the repo; e.g. 'my-repo'
or 'another-repo'. The organization name will automatically be appended.

To use all recently updated repositories in the organization, see [using all repositories](#using-all-repositories).

### Auth

*Note* RSA based auth does not work on Apple Laptops. To run the script on an Apple laptop you **must** add
the `--user-name` and `--auth-token` flags on the commandline. It is helpful to set an environment variable for each of
these in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file.

Currently we need to use a GitHub username and auth token to authenticate the repo mapper, to generate an auth token
see [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

## Script

The provided script can be any executable. It will be run without any arguments at the root of each repository.

The script must be executable in order for repository-mapper to run it, e.g. `chmod +x myscript.sh`

All stdout, stderr, and exit code will automatically be collected for you and will be recorded into the json file which
is written after each run.

### Exit codes

If a script returns a non-zero exit code, repository mapper will not create a commit or pull request in that repository.

You can exit a script with exit code `10` to "skip" the repository and signify there's no work to be done.

Here's one example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello; let me get those files for you!"
ls

echo "This is what an error looks like" >&2

exit 42
```

This will result in the result object:

```json
{
  "repo": "my-repo",
  "stdout": "Hello; let me get those files for you!\nfile-1.txt file2.txt",
  "stderr": "This is what an error looks like",
  "exit_code": 42,
  "pull_request": ""
}
```

## Using All Repositories

If you need to simply get an up-to-date list of all active repositories in your org you can run the `get-all-repos`
script in the scripts directory.
It lists to stdout every repo in your org edited in the last year.
